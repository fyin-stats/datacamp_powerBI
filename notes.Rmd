### Chapter 1

#### Why Power BI

Leading data visualization tool, over 97\% of Fortune 500 companies use Power BI, over 6 million customers.

Power BI components: Power BI Desktop (Desktop version, Data analysis and report creation tool, Includes the Power Query Editor, 100\% free)

Power BI service: Cloud-based version, light report editing, share and distribute reports.

Power BI Pro (publish and share across the Power BI cloud platform)

dataset structure: snowflake scheme, fact table (dynamic) and dimension tables (more static, e.g., holds contact information of customers)



### Chapter 3 - Introduction to DAX

#### DAX functions
predefined formulas that perform calculations on specific values called arguments, function syntax indicates the order of arguments expected

DAX functions examples:

SUM()
LEFT()

POWER BI intellisense

Creating calculations, new column can be based on other columns from any table; creating blank table copy an existing table, defined calculations

calculated as you interact and filter

creating calculations, start with a name and an equal sign

create new table from table view, click the check mark to create the table, drag in new table

add the \& sign to append two columns

#### Calculated measures
in the report view, COUNT(); newly created measure in the table view might not belong to any table, hence need to create a new table, and assign home table to the newly calculated measures.  

creating a measure using existing measures, Average Transaction = DIVIDE(Total Sales, Transaction count)

#### Calculated measures and quick measures
CALCULATE(Aggregation, filter, [filter]...)

Aggregation: SUM(), COUNT(), AVERAGE()

Quick measures: complex measures without writing DAX, menu provides calculations under 6 categories

drag and drop

Time-based calculations: year to date, quarter over quarter growth

provide the ability to create in-depth time analysis

Calculate, 


#### Time-based calculations
Table tools, mark as date table


sameperiodslastyear, always refers to the date table

<!-- When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this: -->

<!-- ```{r cars} -->
<!-- summary(cars) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- ## Including Plots -->

<!-- You can also embed plots, for example: -->

<!-- ```{r pressure, echo=FALSE} -->
<!-- plot(pressure) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot. -->
